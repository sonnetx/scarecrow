# Scarecrow

## Inspiration
We wanted to be able to leverage drones to enhance border security and intimidate assailants while providing information to government officials. With the inspiration of scarecrows from farmer fields, we created a smart system that deters and informs on potentially threatening individuals.

## What it does
Scarecrow is meant to be a software system deployed on a drone or monitoring system that takes in visual information regarding potential assailants and generates (1) a written report, (2) an audio file to warn assailants that they are being monitored and ward them off, and (3) places a phone call to an operator summarizing key information about the assailant(s) observed.

## How we built it
We developed this system using gradio, the OpenAI API, and auxiliary voice processing and outreach libraries.

## Challenges we ran into
This was our first time using a bunch of different Python libraries and navigating them was difficult as we tried to learn their APIs. This was also a good exercise in git and version control as we navigated fast-paced development synchronously.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Integrating so many moving parts was a new challenge for us that we were really pleased that we were able to overcome. All the small moments of ideation and feature implementation were also really rewarding moments!

## What's next for Scarecrow
We hope to be able to translate this technology to real government applications and take in auxiliary data to send drones to high-risk areas. Additionally, we would like to create a more robust data visualization dashboard for human operators to be able to respond fast to any incoming threats. Optimizing report generation would also be important.
